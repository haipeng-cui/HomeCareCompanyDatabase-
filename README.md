Home Care Company provides health care assistance to seniors and disabled people. Many registered nurses work for this company. Patients (Clients) make a contract with thecompany. In the contract information about the client, schedule of nurse visit at home, address of the client, phone number, brief description of the illness of the patient… is stored. We store information about nurses too. Name, phone number, email address, Health Ministry registration number, date of birth … Nurses must record a report about their visit of the patient. They store in the database is they meet the client on the scheduled time or they missed, the health condition of the client and services they provided to the client. There is a possibility that a nurse cannot visit a client and the company substitutes the nurse with another nurse for that temporary period. We have to store this information too. (This description is a draft description and must be completed gradually as the database is developed to reflect the complete description of the final database. The description should contain information about entities, attributes, relationships, cardinality ratios, and constraints…)
